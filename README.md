## üß† Artifact 1 ‚Äî Minimal PRD Prompt (C-L-A-R Format)

**Prompt:**

> **C (Context):** You are an AI product manager helping to draft a minimal Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a lightweight Streamlit application called _Prompt Genius_. The app lets users write, version, and store AI prompts with notes and tags.
> 
> **L (Limits):** Keep it short and incomplete on purpose. Focus only on the most essential sections needed to start development. Avoid implementation details or design mockups.
> 
> **A (Action):** Write a concise PRD scaffold with clear sections for Purpose, Users, Core Features, Non-Goals, and Open Questions. Leave several fields intentionally blank to encourage iteration.
> 
> **R (Result):** Output the PRD in Markdown format.

## üìÑ Artifact 2 ‚Äî Sample Minimal PRD Output

```markdown
# Prompt Genius ‚Äî Minimal PRD (v0.1)

## Purpose
Provide developers and researchers a simple interface to write, store, and iterate on AI prompts.

## Target Users
- Developers exploring AI workflows
- Analysts managing reusable prompts
- Students learning structured prompting

## Core Features
- Create, edit, and tag prompts  
- Save prompt versions with short notes  
- Export or copy prompt text easily  
- (Placeholder for future ideas‚Ä¶)

## Non-Goals
- No authentication or database persistence in MVP  
- No collaborative editing (single-user only)

## Open Questions
- How should versioning be tracked?  
- What metadata should be stored with each prompt?  
- Should AI output examples be saved?  

---

### Artifacts to Create Later
- **ADR 001:** Decision on storage approach (local vs. cloud)
- **README:** Describe purpose, quickstart, and dependencies
- **TODOs:** Track incomplete ideas or future improvements
- **QA Assertions:** Define simple ‚Äúit works when‚Ä¶‚Äù checks
```

## üß™ Artifact 3 ‚Äî Lab Exercise Handout

**Objective:**  
Use the provided PRD prompt to bootstrap your own _Prompt Genius_ concept.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Generate the PRD

1. Paste the Minimal PRD Prompt into your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
    
2. Review the generated PRD ‚Äî note missing sections.
    
3. Ask the model to help you _fill in the blanks_ through iterative prompts.
    

### Step 2 ‚Äî Create Supporting Artifacts

Use prompts like:

- ‚ÄúCreate an ADR documenting our first architectural choice.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúWrite a README.md for this project as if it were open source.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúList 5 To-Dos the model recommends to make this app usable.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúDraft 3 QA assertions that confirm core features are working.‚Äù
    

### Step 3 ‚Äî Prototype It

- Use **Streamlit** to sketch a minimal UI.
    
- Display your prompts in a list.
    
- Add a text box to write or edit one.
    
- Include a simple export or copy button.
    

### Step 4 ‚Äî Reflect

- What did the model assume?
    
- Where did it hallucinate?
    
- How could your initial context improve its answers?

## üöÄ Artifact 4 ‚Äî Advanced Prompt Engineering Steps

**1. Context as Memory**

- Save intermediate prompts and outputs as ‚Äúcontext captures.‚Äù
    
- Compare how output changes as you expand context incrementally.
    

**2. Iterative Refinement**

- Ask the model to _review its own PRD_ for completeness.
    
- Introduce a ‚ÄúFinished?‚Äù check prompt:
    
    > ‚ÄúDoes this PRD provide enough clarity for an engineer to start coding? If not, what‚Äôs missing?‚Äù
    

**3. Prompt Versioning**

- Maintain a version number inside each artifact (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, ‚Ä¶).
    
- Add changelogs describing what was refined in each iteration.
    

**4. Chain-of-Thought Exploration**

- Request the model to outline how it reasoned when creating the PRD.
    
- Example:
    
    > ‚ÄúSummarize the reasoning process you used to decide what sections to include.‚Äù
    

**5. Self-Critique Loop**

- Have the model critique its own prompt and improve it.
    
- Example:
    
    > ‚ÄúEvaluate this prompt‚Äôs clarity and specificity using a 1-5 scale. Suggest one better version.‚Äù
    

**6. Personalization**

- Tailor Prompt Genius to your own workflow:
    
    - Integrate API keys securely.
        
    - Store prompt histories locally.
        
    - Add categories like _research_, _code_, _summarization_.
